# Library API Documentation

## Overview

The Library API provides a robust and efficient way to manage a collection of books in a library. It allows users to perform operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting books from the library's database. The API is built with Express.js and TypeScript, ensuring type safety and scalability.
